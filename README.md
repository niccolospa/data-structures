# data-structures
Repository created to refresh my knowledge on data structures and algorithms tied to them.
//TODO: Write Item interface requirements for all structures.
//TODO: Write good documentation!

*Array*
Arrays of Item, which is a custom ADT.
This ADT contains sortings and basic utility operations.


*List*
List of Item, which is a custom ADT.
This ADT cointains basic operations to use the data structure.
Both singly linked and double linked lists are implemented.

*BST*
Binary search trees (along with the Interval BST variant).
This ADT module comes with a lot of operations, as Overlap check for
Interval BSTs.
AVL BSTs are also present.

*ST*
Symbol tables using strings as key and Items as values.
It's implemented as an Array of Item, a custom ADT.

*Heap*
Implemented as ADT contaning array of Item or array of indexes (with a ST).

*PQ*
Priority queues implemented using Heaps.

*Graph*
Represented with adjacency list, the graph ADT is for undirected weighted graphs.
Different types and representations will be added in the future.
